# RealEstatePredictor

**Basic application that uses machine learning to predict prices of plots**

---

## Overview

RealEstatePredictor is a simple yet functional application designed to estimate plot prices using machine learning. It's structured into separate components for client (frontend), model (ML logic), and server (backend), providing a modular and scalable architecture.

## Features

- Modular architecture separating frontend, backend, and ML model logic
- Predictive functionality to estimate prices of plots using a machine learning model
- Easy to extend: add new features, data inputs, or upgrade the ML model

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python (version used for developing the ML model)
- Node.js / JavaScript tooling for the front end (if applicable)
- Any additional dependencies used in your `model` or `server` folder

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sairishigangarapu/RealEstatePredictor.git
   cd RealEstatePredictor
````

2. Navigate into each module to install dependencies and start services:

   * **Model**:

     ```bash
     cd model
     pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you've created a requirements file
     # Include training or model loading instructions here
     ```
   * **Server**:

     ```bash
     cd ../server
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     # Start backend (e.g., flask, fastapi — whichever you're using):
     python server.py
     ```
   * **Client**:

     ```bash
     cd ../client
     # If using npm or similar:
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

3. Access the application:

   * Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
   * Backend API: `http://localhost:5000/predict` (adjust based on your server config)

---

## Usage

1. Open the frontend.
2. Enter plot details (e.g., area, location, other available features).
3. Submit the form to trigger a request to the backend.
4. Get back the predicted price for the plot.
5. (Optional) View logs, evaluation metrics, or model outputs if integrated.

## Contributing

You're welcome to enhance this project! Here are some ideas to get started:

* Improve the model with additional features or data
* Implement more robust error handling and validation
* Add tests and CI/CD workflows
* Provide a Docker or containerized setup for easier distribution
